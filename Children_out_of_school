## This code was made to analyse data on children out of primary school for various countries over time.
## The Excel file was downloaded from http://www.gapminder.org/data/ (Children out of school, primary)
## and converted to a csv file.

# Start by loading the packages from the library
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

# Now read the csv file and load the data
setwd("C:/Users/Renata/Desktop/EDA with R course/lesson4")
df <- read.csv('children_data.csv', header = T, na.strings = "NA", sep = ";", check.names = F)
head(df)

# Data seems perfect! Now let´s analyse how the number of children out of school changed over the years.
# Starting with some stats for 1970
summary(df$`1970`)

# And the histogram. 

qplot(x = df$`1970`, binwidth = 0.5,
      xlab = "Children out of school in 1970",
      ylab = "Frequency") +
   scale_x_log10()

# For 2011 

summary(df$`2011`)

qplot(x = df$`2011`, binwidth = 0.5,
      xlab = "Children out of school in 2011",
      ylab = "Frequency") +
  scale_x_log10()

# For 2001

summary(df$`2001`)

qplot(x = df$`2001`, binwidth = 0.5,
      xlab = "Children out of school in 2001",
      ylab = "Frequency") +
  scale_x_log10()

# It seems numbers increased from 1970 to 2001, and then decreased in 2011.
# To investigate that let´s do a plot that shows total number of children out of school over the period sampled


years_x <- c(seq(1970, 2011, 1))
years_x

sumPerYear <- colSums(df[,-1], na.rm = T)
sumPerYear

qplot(x = years_x, y = sumPerYear,
      xlab = "Year",
      ylab = "Total number of children out of school worldwide")

# Interestingly the number of children out of school reached a peak in 2000 and then started dropping.
# But as this is a very incomplete dataset, this cannot be taken as true (yet).
# E.g. the peak in 1971 is explained by the presence of data from India, which only appears in this year and then in 1999.
# Let's see what happens excluding India from the sum

sumWithoutIndia <- colSums(df[-102,-1], na.rm = T)
qplot(x = years_x, y = sumWithoutIndia,
      xlab = "Year",
      ylab = "Total number of children out of school worldwide (India excluded)")

# The 1971 outlier is gone. China might be inflating numbers too.
sumWithoutChina <- colSums(df[-45,-1], na.rm = T)
qplot(x = years_x, y = sumWithoutChina,
      xlab = "Year",
      ylab = "Total number of children out of school worldwide (China excluded)")

# It seems the overall trend was steadily increasing up until early 2000s, and might be dropping since then.
# Recent data would be necessary to confirm this trend.
