## This code was created to look at the cakes dataset that comes in alr3 and find out in whick conditions the best rated cakes are baked ##

library(ggplot2)
library(alr3)
data(cakes)
head(cakes)
summary(cakes)

# Cakes variables: X1 = baking time (min), X2 = baking temperature (F), Y = palatability score (0-10)

# Histrogram to see the distribution of palatability scores
ggplot(aes(x = Y), data = cakes) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlab("Cakes palatability score")

# Create a variable of score bins

cakes$score.bins <- cut(cakes$Y, breaks = c(0, 5, 7, 8, 9), right = T)

# Histogram showing the distribution of baking time coloured by score bins
ggplot(aes(x = X1), data = cakes) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = score.bins)) +
  xlab("Baking time (min)")

# Scatter plot of baking time vs. score
ggplot(aes(x = Y, y = X1), data = cakes) +
  geom_point(aes(color = score.bins)) +
  xlab("Cakes palatability score") +
  ylab("Baking time (min)")

# Scatter plot of baking temperature vs. score
ggplot(aes(x = Y, y = X2), data = cakes) +
  geom_point(aes(color = score.bins)) +
  xlab("Cakes palatability score") +
  ylab("Baking temperature (F)")

# The highest chance of making the perfect(ish) cake: baking it for 35 min at 350 F!
